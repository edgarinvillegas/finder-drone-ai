1) If you want to use yolo (very likely), please download the model from here:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nLw9T2f2qoWeLsJ6Rwz4GklBaA1Bvdda
(alternate link: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/static.pyimagesearch.com/opencv-yolo/yolo-object-detection.zip?__s=pyri6sq6kf2bmdenxa8k)
Extract and copy the entire yolo-coco folder to this project's "/models" folder, so that you have /models/yolo-coco/yolov3.weights

2) Play with the input-model-output combination on main.py (around lines 18-28)

3) Run the code
```
    python main.py
```  

4) Repeat from step #2 :) 

### Package requirements
- opencv
- imutils
